https://github.com/zzncnb/geog5990-assignment1

Create an animation model to display the movement of the sheep when eating grass.

## Usages

Create a tkinter window to run the animation model displaying the movement of the sheep when eating grass. 

## Code status and development roadmap

This code is developed and Stored in src folder.

There are 3 files stored in src folder which are in.txt, model.py, and agentframework.py.

in.txt files is a text file with some comma separated variable data. It is raster data and it's value is equivalent to the pixel in the image arranged in the grid. the text file is opened using the CSV reading code. In this way, it is read in a 2D list. 
The URL to download the in.txt files: https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/practicals/python/agent-framework/part6/in.txt

model.py file helps run the annimation model to test the movement for sheep and displays the coordinate points for their movement. 

agentframework.py includes Agent class. It initialises the agents in a random location, and moves them into the agent class.
